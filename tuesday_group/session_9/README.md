  * BlackJack https://codepen.io/rockwellwindsor/pen/yLpMNzX
    * set up the function to run:
      * Create a variable called `count`
      * Assign that variable to the return of a function called `countTheCards`
      * Pass the value of the card number to the function when assigning it `countTheCards(card_num)`
      * your code should be just one line and be in the following format:  `var variable_name = function_name(value_passed_in);`
