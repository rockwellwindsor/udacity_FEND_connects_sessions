  * Introduction to Javascript

  * Tip for debugging Javascript errors
    * Utilize console.log() to show you what data exists at a certain point.
    * I suggest debugging in the follow areas:
      * Right at the beginning of the function
        * Verify the data that is getting sent
      * Inside any conditionals
        * Verify what data is triggering what part of the conditionals
      * At the end of the function
        * Verify what data is being returned
