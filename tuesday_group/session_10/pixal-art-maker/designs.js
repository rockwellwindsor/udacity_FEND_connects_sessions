// 1. Create a variable and set its value to the the table area element (pixelCanvas)

//    2a. When the form is submitted we need to grab the height value being set and the width value being set
//    2b. We need to clear out whatever the current table set up is
//    2c. We need to call the makeGrid function and pass it the height and width values
// 3. Using the height and width values we need to make the grid
//    3a. Using a for loop we need to append tr elements to the table (tr = row)
//    3b. Using a for loop We need to also set the number of columns in the table (td = column)
//    3c. We need to place an event listener on each cell in the table so when it is clicked we change it's color
// Gotchas
// * When a form is submitted the default is to refresh the page, how can we stop that?
// * What is the proper place to grab the color value, or perhaps better put, when is the proper time to grab the color value?
